# 📊 Multivariate A/B Testing with Logistic Regression

This project explores a **Multivariate A/B Test (MVT)** setup where users are shown different combinations of price points, discount levels, and marketing channels. The objective is to identify which combinations drive higher conversion and revenue, and to evaluate the statistical impact of various features on conversion using **logistic regression**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains user-level session data with the following fields:

| Column               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| user_id              | Unique identifier for each user                 |
| price_point          | Price shown to user                             |
| discount_percent     | Discount applied                                |
| marketing_channel    | Source of traffic (email, social, etc.)         |
| device               | Device used during session                      |
| location             | Country of user                                 |
| gender               | Gender of user                                  |
| age                  | Age of user                                     |
| session_duration     | Time spent in session (in seconds)              |
| pages_viewed         | Pages viewed in the session                     |
| conversion           | 1 if purchase made, else 0                      |
| revenue              | Calculated as conversion × price_point          |

## 🔍 Objectives

- Evaluate conversion and revenue across different MVT combinations.
- Identify top-performing combinations.
- Fit a logistic regression model to understand the impact of various features on conversion.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### ✅ 1. Create New Features
- `revenue` column = `conversion × price_point`
- `combo` column = concatenation of price, discount, and channel

### ✅ 2. Grouped Analysis
- Conversion and revenue calculated by `(price, discount, channel)` combinations.
- Top 10 combinations ranked by `revenue_per_user`.

### ✅ 3. Logistic Regression
- One-hot encoded categorical variables:
  - `price_point`, `discount_percent`, `marketing_channel`, `device`, `location`, `gender`
- Target variable: `conversion`
- Evaluated statistical significance of each variable.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Top-performing combo:**  
  `Price: $29.99 | Discount: 5% | Channel: direct`  
  → `Revenue per user = $6.25`, `Conversion rate ≈ 20.8%`

- **Logistic Regression Results:**
  - Most coefficients not statistically significant (`p > 0.05`)
  - Only `price_point_29.99` had a significant negative impact on conversion (`p = 0.002`)
  - Pseudo R-squared = **0.0024** → Model explains very little variance

| Variable               | Coef     | P-Value  | Significance |
|------------------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| price_point_29.99      | -0.27    | 0.002    | ✅ Significant |
| device_mobile          | 0.015    | 0.823    | ❌            |
| location_UK            | -0.02    | 0.818    | ❌            |
| gender_male            | 0.03     | 0.659    | ❌            |

> ℹ️ Most categorical variables had **no significant impact** on conversion at 95% confidence level.
