# üîÑ Churn Prediction using XGBoost

This project uses a real-world customer dataset to build a churn prediction model using **XGBoost**. The objective is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their subscription behavior and discount history.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

| Feature              | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `subscription_length`| Number of months the customer has subscribed    |
| `monthly_price`      | Price paid per month                            |
| `total_spent`        | Total amount spent over the subscription period |
| `support_tickets`    | Number of customer support interactions         |
| `competitor_price`   | Price offered by a competitor                   |
| `discount_received`  | Discount the customer received                  |
| `churn`              | 1 if customer churned, 0 otherwise              |

## üìà Conclusion

Churn Prediction with XGBoost
The model performs well in predicting customer churn, with an overall accuracy of 87% and a strong ROC AUC score of 0.95, indicating excellent class separation.

Key metrics:
Precision (Churn = 1): 0.89 ‚Äî 89% of predicted churn cases were correct.
Recall (Churn = 1): 0.86 ‚Äî The model correctly identified 86% of actual churners.

Balanced performance for both churners and non-churners, making it reliable for real-world deployment.

Confusion Matrix Insight:
863 churners correctly predicted, 144 missed
886 non-churners correctly predicted, 107 misclassified

Overall, the model is highly effective for early churn detection and can support targeted retention strategies.
