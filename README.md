# 🧠 Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Analyst project portfolio! This repository showcases a series of data science projects focused on pricing, revenue optimization, and marketing experiments. All projects are built using Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and real or simulated data.

## 📂 Project Categories

### 1️⃣ Price Elasticity and Demand Forecasting
- **Log-log regression** to estimate price elasticity of demand
- **ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet** models for time series demand forecasting
- **Multivariate linear regression** to model demand based on multiple drivers
- **Customer segmentation** using clustering for tailored pricing strategies

### 2️⃣ Revenue and Profit Optimization
- **Polynomial regression** to find optimal price points
- **Bayesian optimization** to fine-tune discount & promo strategies
- **Market basket analysis** for bundle pricing
- **Churn prediction** for subscription-based products

### 3️⃣ A/B Testing
- **Classic A/B split test** for pricing experiments
- **Multivariate A/B tests** to compare multiple price/promo variants
